                        <h3>Graded Discussion - Post a Question/Answer a Question (aka Give and Receive Help)</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>You are required to post at least 1 question about the material we are covering this week in the discussion board.</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Pretty much any question related to what we're doing this week is fair game.</li>
                                <li>Questions about reading or video content.</li>
                                <li>Questions about quiz questions you're having trouble with.</li>
                                <li>Questions about how to do something in the software we're using.</li>
                                <li>Questions about where to find things if you can't find something related to the course.</li>
                                <li>Questions if you're getting error messages or if something doesn't seem to work right for you.</li>
                                <li>If you have a question or problem it's likely someone else may have the same question.</li>
                                <li>I prefer to answer questions on the discussion board rather than through email.</li>
                                <li>If you have a question that is is related to class content and not a personal matter, then I will likely refer you to the discussion board to ask it and receive an answer.</li>
                                <li>Stupid questions are the ones you had and didn't get the answer to. We're all here to learn.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <li>You are required to answer at least 1 question posted by someone else this week.</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Explaining things to someone else is a great learning activity.</li>
                                <li>This is a graduate level course. A great deal of learning at this level is collaborative. You are expected to contribute to your own and other class members' understanding of the material.</li>
                                <li>Statistics is a very broad (and sometimes complicated) topic. No one person knows it all. Share what you do know or understand. It's OK to have several people contribute parts of an answer to a question or elaborate on the answers already given.</li>
                                <li>One sentence answers will not receive full credit. If you can answer an easy one with one sentence, great! Answer another to receive full credit.</li>
                                <li>Short comments or observations about a question or someone's answer will also not receive full credit. (i.e. "I agree.", "I had that problem, too.", "That's interesting.") Feel free to comment, but make sure you actually answer someone's question to receive full credit.</li>
                                <li>Late questions and responses don't do anyone much good. Completing the assignment after it's due will receive a maximum of half credit.</li>

                        <h3>Online Quiz</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Complete the online quiz for this week week. (unlimited attempts, keep your highest score)</li>
                            <li>The quiz is more a learning exercise than a test of what you know.</li>
                            <li>The quiz covers topics I consider important for the week. (That's mostly based on what topics I think you may encounter as a working informaticist with a graduate degree who is expected to advise others on what information to work with and how to do it.) While informaticists may not be statisticians, informaticists participate in key decisions about what information to look at and how it's used. You could give some really bad (and potentially expensive) advice if you're ignorant about how things will be used later or in other settings.</li>
                            <li>We will be reviewing a lot of material each week. There's no point in trying to memorize it all. If you want to know what I consider important for that week, TAKE THE QUIZ.</li>
                            <li>HINT: Taking the quizzes is a GREAT way to study for the tests.</li>
                            <li>The quizzes are built with question banks. You may notice the questions may be different each time you take the quiz. Taking the quiz several times is a great way to be exposed to as much of the material as possible.</li>
                            <li>Suggestions for success taking the quizzes:</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Take the quiz early in the week so you can ask questions and receive help if needed.</li>
                                <li>Take the quiz a couple times before doing anything else for the week. That will give you an idea of the important things I'm looking for.</li>
                                <li>Complete the assigned readings and watch the videos. Watch for things mentioned in the quiz.</li>
                                <li>Take the quiz again later in the week before it's due to improve your score.</li>
                                
                            </ul>
